# üìâ Panel Data Analysis on Poverty Rate in West Java Province

This project aims to analyze the determinants of poverty in **West Java Province, Indonesia**, using **panel data regression** methods including **Pooled Regression**, **Fixed Effect Model (FEM)**, and **Random Effect Model (REM)**. West Java is one of the provinces with a consistently high poverty rate compared to other regions in Indonesia.

## üìå Abstract

Reducing poverty is a central goal in the economic development of any country. This study investigates the significant factors influencing poverty levels in West Java Province using panel data from **27 districts/cities** over the period **2018‚Äì2022**. 

Three panel regression models were applied:
- **Pooled Least Squares**
- **Fixed Effect Model (FEM)**
- **Random Effect Model (REM)**

The analysis found that the **Fixed Effect Model (FEM)** was the most suitable, and that both the **unemployment rate** and **Human Development Index (HDI/IPM)** significantly affect the poverty rate in the region.

## üß† Background

Economic development should not only focus on economic growth, but also on reducing poverty. According to Todaro (2000), a nation's development success should be measured not only by Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), but also by its ability to reduce poverty.

West Java has one of the highest poverty rates in Indonesia, and this study focuses on evaluating factors such as:
- **Unemployment**
- **Income disparity**
- **Social-economic conditions**
- **Government expenditure**
- **Human Development Index (HDI)**

These indicators are used to assess their significance in influencing the poverty rate, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for effective policymaking.
